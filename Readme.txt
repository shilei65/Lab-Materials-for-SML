Lab R and Python: 
You could directly open the '.html' files to see the examples. The files include: 
1. A simple example for Linear Regression implemented with R on Advertising data.
2. A simple example for Logistic Regression implemented with R  and python on Stock Market data.
3. Stock Price Prediction of Apple Inc. using Deep Learning method（Long short-term memory）with Python



Homework:
In the fold of named by homework, there is a data set which contains the data studied in deep-learning demonstration. We reformed several binary variables with up or down for the close price, adjusted close price, and so on. Please select one binary variable as response and establish a logistic regression model, finally making prediction and statistical inference. You can freely choose binary variable but ensure that your choice is reasonable and interpretable. You also can form other variables such Lag1 ,Lag2 as that in the example demonstration and include them in the models.
